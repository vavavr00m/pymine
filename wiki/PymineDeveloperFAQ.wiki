== Error: No module named pymine.api ==

=== Issue ===

I'm trying to setup pymine on our server. I've checkouted svn code and installed missing packages. After running make setup in code root I've got the following:

{{{
Entering directory '/svn/pymine-read-only'
python manage.py syncdb --noinput --traceback
Error: No module named pymine.api
make[1]: *** [dbsync] Error 1
make[1]: Leaving directory '/svn/pymine-read-only'
make: *** [setup] Error 1
}}}

what have I done wrong ?

=== Answer ===

That `pymine-read-only` is the problem; regardless of the documented GoogleCode checkout process, the pymine directory needs to be called "pymine", otherwise the package import mechanism gets confused.  

  # Rename that directory to "pymine".
  # And then do `make clobber`  
  # And then `make setup`
