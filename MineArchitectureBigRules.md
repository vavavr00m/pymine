# Overall #
  * if it's not yours, it's not a mine
    * only you get to decide what "yours" means
  * the subscriber gets what you choose to give them, and nothing more
    * subscribers do not "take", they are "given"

# Architecture #
  1. invent nothing
  1. content neutral
  1. platform neutral
  1. no magical protocols
  1. no magical data formats
  1. no external service dependencies
  1. "transport secrecy" is out of scope
  1. "transport authentication" is out of scope
  1. "discovery" is not merely out of scope, it is antithetical

# Development #
  1. no premature optimisation
    * ...includes "not solving problems before you have them"
  1. no burden on the subscriber that cannot be addressed by vanilla firefox
    * ...by which we do not include "use a plugin"
