# Welcome to Pymine #

Pymine! is the first implementation of The Mine Project software, in Python/Django.

See http://themineproject.org/about/ for an introduction about what Mine! software does, and a developer overview is available at http://themineproject.org/developer/

Source code download is via Subversion as explained using the "Source" tab above, and occasionally we roll Ubuntu ".deb" packages which are available under the "Downloads" tab.

For reference **only**, there is also the Mine! prototype, "protomine" (Perl/CGI) at http://code.google.com/p/protomine/ - however the implementation of the mine has evolved considerably since that codebase was completed.
